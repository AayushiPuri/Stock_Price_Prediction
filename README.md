# Stock Price Prediction

Time series based project for predicting the stock price of a company using previous prices

For the dataset, we can download the stock performance of any stock from Kaggle.
I have downloaded the data for stock of HCL Tech from Kaggle Datsets .

Libraries used:
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn

As part of the data cleaning process, I have dropped the NA values from the dataset and created a different function to divide the dataset into the training and testing data.
X_Lately contains the data that we will use for predictions. I have trained a Linear Regression Model and a Decision Tree Model.
Both models gave a MAE score of 0.0005 and 0.0011.
Thank you!
